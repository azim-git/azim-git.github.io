## 🍛 A Comfort Dish Close to My Heart

:::columns

Nasi Ayam, or Malay-style chicken rice, is more than just a meal — it's a nostalgic dish wrapped in steam and the warmth of home. I remember walking into my grandmother’s kitchen on lazy Sunday afternoons, the air thick with the aroma of garlic, ginger, and pandan leaves. She never measured anything — just instincts and years of love guiding her hands.

This recipe is a humble tribute to those weekends and all the times we gathered around the table, fighting over who got the drumstick.

## 🍴 Instructions

### 1. Boil the Chicken

1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil.
2. Add ginger slices, garlic, and spring onion.
3. Gently lower the chicken in and boil for about **30–40 minutes** until fully cooked.
4. Remove the chicken, brush it with sesame oil, and set aside.
5. Reserve the broth — you’ll use it for both the rice and soup.

> **Anecdote**: When I made this in university for the first time, I forgot to reserve the broth and poured it out. I had to redo the chicken all over again — I never made that mistake again.

### 2. Cook the Rice

1. In a pot or rice cooker, heat the chicken fat or oil.
2. Sauté garlic and ginger until fragrant.
3. Add pandan leaves and drained rice. Stir for a minute.
4. Add the chicken broth and a pinch of salt.
5. Cook until the rice is fluffy and fragrant.

> **Pro tip**: My auntie swears by adding a *tiny* splash of evaporated milk into the rice to make it creamier — I still do this secretly.

### 3. Make the Soup

1. Bring the reserved broth to a gentle simmer.
2. Add carrots, salt, and pepper.
3. Let it boil until carrots are tender.
4. Top with fried shallots and spring onions.

### 4. Blend the Chili Sauce

1. Blend all chili sauce ingredients until smooth.
2. Adjust with lime juice or broth depending on how tangy or runny you want it.

> **Memory lane**: My cousin once used bird’s eye chilies instead — we all cried halfway through dinner but couldn’t stop eating.

## 🍽️ Serving Suggestions

- Plate the rice using a small bowl mold.
- Slice the chicken and arrange neatly beside the rice.
- Drizzle light soy sauce over the chicken.
- Serve with the soup, chili sauce, and fresh cucumber slices.

## 🧡 Final Thoughts

Nasi Ayam isn’t just a dish — it’s a memory, a hug, and a flavor bomb all in one. Every household has its own twist, so make this your own. And remember: even if the rice is a little mushy or the chicken a bit dry, it’ll still taste better with stories around the table.
