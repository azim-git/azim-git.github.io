## Whac-A-Mole

This project was a collaborative effort undertaken by my group and me during either Trimester 1 or Trimester 2 â€” I must admit the exact timing escapes me at the moment. It was a well-executed and thoughtfully developed piece of work that we were genuinely proud of. Despite our strong effort and the quality of the final outcome, the project ultimately received a grade of B. While we were slightly disappointed by the result, we still regard it as a valuable learning experience that demonstrated our teamwork and commitment.
