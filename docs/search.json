    "text": "GenAI used\nChatGPT was used for the entire assessment. It is the one I am most familiar in and is competent enough for tasks like these.\n\n\nUsage\nIt helped me to generate the templates which I used to then fill up with the relevant necessary information. I leveraged it to generate for me the perfect Nasi Ayam recipe which I then added on with my own personal anecdotal experiences to spice up the reading experience.\n\n\nBenefits\nIt can quickly deliver personalised content in a readable manner and also generate simple blocks of code that can be copied and pasted into projects seamlessly.\n\n\nChallenges\nWhen working on a complex project, GenAI can fail to understand all the nuances of the code and may not deliver working solutions. During some debugging sessions especially, it may just repeat a previously generated message over and over again with no change - not helpful at all.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIt is important to be specific and give as much information to the GenAI in use as possible, as only then will they be able to deliver content that is personalised to you. If you are vague and think that it will solve all your problems magically just with a simple prompt, it won’t be useful."

Boil the Chicken\n\nIn a large pot, bring water to a boil.\nAdd ginger slices, garlic, and spring onion.\nGently lower the chicken in and boil for about 30–40 minutes until fully cooked.\nRemove the chicken, brush it with sesame oil, and set aside.\nReserve the broth — you’ll use it for both the rice and soup.\n\n\nAnecdote: When I made this in university for the first time, I forgot to reserve the broth and poured it out. I had to redo the chicken all over again — I never made that mistake again.\n\n\n\n\n2. Cook the Rice\n\nIn a pot or rice cooker, heat the chicken fat or oil.\nSauté garlic and ginger until fragrant.\nAdd pandan leaves and drained rice. Stir for a minute.\nAdd the chicken broth and a pinch of salt.\nCook until the rice is fluffy and fragrant.\n\n\nPro tip: My auntie swears by adding a tiny splash of evaporated milk into the rice to make it creamier — I still do this secretly.\n\n\n\n\n3. Make the Soup\n\nBring the reserved broth to a gentle simmer.\nAdd carrots, salt, and pepper.\nLet it boil until carrots are tender.\nTop with fried shallots and spring onions.\n\n\n\n\n4. Blend the Chili Sauce\n\nBlend all chili sauce ingredients until smooth.\nAdjust with lime juice or broth depending on how tangy or runny you want it.\n\n\nMemory lane: My cousin once used bird’s eye chilies instead — we all cried halfway through dinner but couldn’t stop eating."
